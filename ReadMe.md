Chuck Norris Project- Overview

The purpose of my project is to bring light and maybe even a laugh to someone's day. It's desgined for someone to spend a few moments possibly a few minutes cycling through some random Chuck Norris jokes. The user might even be so inclined to peak at Chuck Norris's bio to see how the jokes started and why they have become an ordeal on the internet.

Functionality-

The functionality is simple on this site. Click either the 'Get Joke of the Day" button or the "Chuck Norris Bio" button to read their texts. I decided to implement a timeout function feature for both of my modals so they flash on screen to see the features of the site. I purposely set it for a short amount of time because of this. After the modals disappear, you will need to press the physical buttons in  the top left corner to finish reading Chuck's bio or gathering a different random quote. You also need to click the close buttons to either close the bio or the joke of the day.

I was able to get my main background to be functional, I had a hard time with getting both of the modules to cooperate.
